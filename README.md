# qBraid OpenQasm-Parser Challenge 

Hello!

We are Team Physicsfeed, part of the qBraid-Amazon Braket challenge at QChack-2022.

We worked on the OpenQASM-Parser problem where we built the Parser which is able to breakdown Amazon Braket quantum circuit objects into a parameterized sets of physical logic gates. 

A Parser is a program, usually part of a compiler, that receives input in the form of sequential source program instructions, interactive online commands, markup tags, or some other defined interface and breaks them up into parts (for example, the nouns (objects), verbs (methods).

# OpenQasm
Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM) is an intermediate representation for quantum instructions. The language was first described in a paper published in July 2017, and a reference source code implementation was released as part of IBM's Quantum Information Software Kit (Qiskit) for use with their IBM Quantum Experience cloud quantum computing platform. The language has similar qualities to traditional hardware description languages such as Verilog.
